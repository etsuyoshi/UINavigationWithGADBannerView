# UINavigationWithGADBannerView
[This repo is for comment to StackOverFlow Question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30002758/gadbannerview-does-not-set-height)

In the ViewController,
I didn't set proper height of GADBannerView.

So setting up in AppDelegate(FYI. applicationDidBecomeActive method) could work.
